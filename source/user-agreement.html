In connection with the decisions of the arbitrator (administrator), the agreed amount may be withdrawn from the Seller's account in favor of the Buyer, in order to ensure his financial security in accordance with the rules of our exchange. If the goods have caused moral, material or any other damage to the Buyer, the arbitrator shall not be entitled to withdraw from the Seller's account the amount of damage claimed by the Buyer, as this is contrary to the policies of our exchange.
