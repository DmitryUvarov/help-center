                        <p>You may have already heard that many large platforms create referral systems to attract new users to
                            a team of like-minded people. This is beneficial for both parties: the site gets the opportunity to
                            advertise among a larger number of people, as well as the opportunity to attract a new audience from
                            trusted persons, that is, you — our clients, and you get a good reward for inviting new project participants.</p>

                        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                        <p>The referral system on our exchange is divided into three stages:</p>
                        <p>A :a group of people who registered directly with your link B :friends of your referrals, who, in turn, were
                            invited by category “A” referrals and registered by their referral code C :registered users on a referral link
                            of a referral from category “B” Thus, the Monowork.com referral system consists of three stages.</p>

                        <h3>Who are referrals and why are they needed?</h3>
                        <p>A referral is a partner program participant who has registered on the recommendation of another participant.
                            A referral is also a full-fledged user of the Monowork.com Exchange, without any restrictions. The person
                            who brought the new member to the project will receive a commission (referral). Accordingly, the more
                            people click on the link, the more passive earnings the referrer will have</p>

                        <h3>What kind of reward awaits you?</h3>
                        <p>As we mentioned above, the updated referral system includes as many as three stages of referrals,
                            respectively, the rewards will also vary for you depending on your category. For category A referrals you get
                            50% of the commission, category B referrals will bring you 10%, and for category C you will get 2.5% of the
                            commission.</p>
                        <p>For each referral you will receive your percentage, but this percentage will depend on the referral category:
                            A, B or C.</p>
                        <p>At the moment, the referral system and the ability to create an unlimited number of referral codes are only
                            available to premium users.</p>
                        <p>Monowork.com referral program packs these key features:</p>
