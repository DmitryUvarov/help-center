This article explains three types of withdrawal status, as well as what you can do if you haven't received your withdrawal or mistakenly withdrawn to the wrong address, according to different withdrawal statuses.</strong></p>
                        <h3 id="h_01G1DAHPTW112AA5ZTAT6Y149T"><strong>1. Three Types of Withdrawal Status</strong></h3>
                        <p>The time needed for a crypto withdrawal varies from coin to coin, ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. You can check the status of each withdrawal request on the Monowork withdrawal page.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Go to Monowork and log in with your account, then check the status of your withdrawal through
                            <strong>Personal Area - Withdraw</strong>. There are three types of withdrawal status:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pending:</strong> it means we are processing the withdrawal, and it may take 2 - 3 hours.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li><strong>Success: </strong>it means we have processed your withdrawal, and the transaction has been recorded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li><strong>Error: </strong>this means that the transaction was not completed due to account restrictions.&nbsp;</li>
                        </ul>
