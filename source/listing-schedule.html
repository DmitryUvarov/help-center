                        <img src="img/03.jpg" width="765" height="400" alt="">

                        <p>Token listing is a very serious process that requires a serious approach. In our domain.site team,
                            there are specialists who are engaged in the selection of tokens that should be presented on our exchange.
                            Let's take a closer look at this process.</p>
                        <h3>Assessment token of the project</h2>
                            <p>domain.site has mandatory requirements for the organization's token that must be met. Here are some of them:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>go through the initial domain.site review</li>
                                <li>have technical value and / or real applicationv
                                <li>pass our risk assessment</li>
                                <li>timely send updates to our team</li>
                                <li>get tested with DeepIt or Certik code</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Basic token listing procedure</h2>
                                <p>Token listing is a fairly thorough process that we are responsible for:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>passing the initial token verification, after which we contact the organization by email</li>
                                    <li>sending the listing conditions on domain.site to the project team via email</li>
                                    <li>the project team must complete and sign the application form and the letter of commitment to confirm acceptance</li>
                                    <li>we pay for the transfer of tokens</li>
                                    <li>add the token to the list for trading on domain.site </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The listing procedure is the process of verifying compliance with all the conditions and requirements of an organization's token.
                                    <b>Only in full compliance with all the above points, our team allows the token to be listed on the exchange.</b>
                                </p>
                                <h3>Token delist rules at domain.site </h2>
                                    <p>The exchange also reserves the right to exclude the token from the listing. How does this happen:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>dissolution of the official team at the time of listing</li>
                                        <li>the appearance of technical problems affecting trade</li>
                                        <li>increase in token supply and / or malicious trading on the domain.site platform</li>
                                        <li>request stop marketing due to strategic adjustment and the need for development</li>
                                        <li>a fall in the weekly transaction volume below 100 thousand US dollars and / or limited deposits remaining
                                            on the domain.site cryptocurrency exchange</li>
                                        <li>failure to provide us with weekly / monthly reports at domain.site .zendesk.com and more</li>
                                    </ul>
