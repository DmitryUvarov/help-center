                        <h2>Price Terms</h2>

                        <h3>Spot Trading</h2>
                            <p>This type of trading occurs in the spot market at the current price. When you are engaged in spot trading, you make a deal at an affordable bid and ask price, which is requested by other market participants. To complete a trade, you need to have available assets to pay for the trade by the settlement date.
                                For example, if you are going to make a purchase of BTC in the amount of $1,500, then you must make a deposit by the date of settlement of at least the specified amount. Usually the date is calculated according to the T + 2 trading day scheme. Otherwise, the exchange will refuse to enter the Bitcoin position.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Margin Trading</h2>
                                <p>With margin trading, you borrow funds from a third party to increase your position. Margin and spot trading are different. With margin trading, you do not need the full amount of the transaction to open a position, you just need to have assets that will be on the margin of the position you are going to open.
                                    <b>For example</b>, you are going to buy BTC for $1000. Some platforms are ready to provide you with up to 100x leverage. That is, you only need $10 on your account to trade Bitcoin for $1,000 BTC.
                                    To keep a position open, you only need to hold 1% (with 100x leverage) of the contract amount. Depending on the course of the trade, you can open even more positions or withdraw profits.
                                </p>
                                <h3>What to choose?</h2>
                                    <p><b>Spot Trading: benefits</b>
                                        Management of risks: trading occurs only with your own balance, which you actually own, that is, the impossibility of going into a negative.
                                        Guarantee: spot trading takes place only on own assets. In this way, the exchange ensures that you avoid over-leveraging. </p>
                                    <p><b>Spot Trading: limitations</b>
                                        Missed trading opportunities: even with confidence in the deal, you will not be able to earn 100% or more, you will only be able to earn the amount that your capital allows.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><b>Margin Trading: benefits</b>
                                        Possibility of increasing profits: the presence of leverage allows you to increase your trade up to 100 times in comparison with your capital.
                                        Low-frequency trading: an increased likelihood of trades identified in this type of trading. </p>
                                    <p><b>Margin Trading: limitations</b>
                                        Risks: Opportunity to lose more money than the initial investment.
                                        Liquidation: complete liquidation of a position with insufficient funds to cover losses.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>What strategy should you follow?</h2>
                                        <p>It all depends on your usual trading style and your character: are you tolerant of risks, what knowledge about investing you have.
                                            Choose the strategies that are right for you.
                                        </p>
