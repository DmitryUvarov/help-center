                        <h2>AML&CFT Policy</h2>

                        <p> Money laundering is defined as the process where the identity of the proceeds of crime is so disguised
                            that it gives an impression of legitimate income. Criminals specifically target financial services firms
                            through which they attempt to launder criminal proceeds without the firm's knowledge or suspicion.</p>
                        <p> In response to the scale and effect of money laundering, the European Union has passed Directive
                            designed to combat money laundering and terrorism. These Directives, together with regulations, rules
                            and industry guidance, form the cornerstone of our AML/CTF obligations and outline the offenses and
                            penalties for failing to comply.</p>
                        <p> Whilst domain.site is currently unregulated and does not fall within the scope of the AML/CFT
                            obligations, the senior management have implemented systems and procedures that meet the standardss
                            et forth by the European Union. This decision reflects the senior management's desire to prevent money
                            laundering and not be used by criminals to launder proceeds of crime.</p>

                        <h3>Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy:</h3>
                        <p>The domain.site's AML Policy is designed to prevent money laundering by meeting the European
                            standards on combating money laundering and terrorism financing, including the need to have
                            adequate systems and controls in place to mitigate the risk of the firm being used to facilitate
                            financial crime. This AML Policy sets out the minimum standards which must be complied
                            with and includes:</p>

                                regulations, rules and industry guidance;</li>
                            <li>Establishing and maintaining a Risk-Based Approach (RBA) to the assessment and management of

                                a higher risk, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs);</li>
                            <li>Establishing and maintaining risk-based systems and procedures for the monitoring of on-going
                                customer activity;</li>
