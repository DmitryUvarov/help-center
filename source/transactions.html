                        <h3>What’s a wallet address?</h2>
                            <p>A wallet is a digital place where you can store cryptocurrency coins. A wallet address is a randomly generated combination of
                                digits and letters that is associated with a particular wallet.
                                Just figure out what coin has it’s unique wallet address. Go to Personal area – Transfer and look for a compatible wallet for Bitcoin,
                                Bitcoincash, Ethereum. As a rule, each coin has its official wallet client. </p>
                            <h3>Can I use transfer to send cryptocurrency coins outside this exchange platform?</h2>
                                <p>Yes, but in this case, crediting of funds may take longer.
                                    If you wish to send cryptocurrency coins outside the platform, please, use Personal Area – Withdraw </p>
                                <h3>What's the recipient’s address?</h2>
                                    <p>In any transaction there is always a sender and a recipient. The recipient’s address is the wallet address
                                        where you will send the currency. For example, if you want to send Ether (ETH), you should specify an
                                        ETH wallet address in the recipient field, and Exchange Crypto Platform will send coins to this address
                                        once the transaction is complete. </p>
                                    <h3>What is the maximal/minimal amount?</h2>
                                        <p>There is no maximum amount. You can see the minimum amount when you try to withdraw funds or transfer. </p>
                                        <h3> How do I cancel my transaction?</h2>
                                            <p> Unfortunately, blockchain transactions are irreversible. Once a transaction is made (money is sent to
                                                a particular wallet address), it cannot be rolled back. So, if you are going to exchange cryptocurrency,
                                                be sure to double check all payment details carefully before sending. </p>
                                            <h3> Why is my wallet address recognized as invalid?</h2>
                                                <p> If your wallet address is recognized as invalid, it is usually for one of the following reasons:
                                                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;margin-left: 0;padding-left: 20px;">
                                                    <li> Make sure your wallet address matches the chosen cryptocurrency.</li>
                                                    <li> You are trying to make transfer to address outside the Exchange Crypto Platform.</li>
                                                    <li>There was a typo or character missing in the address you provided. Make sure that the address you specify matches the actual address of your wallet.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                </p>
