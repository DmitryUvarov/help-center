                        <p>This trading scheme for cryptocurrency exchanges is extremely simple. You buy cryptocurrency on one exchange at a low price and
                            sell it on another exchange for as much as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>It is a simple and profitable cryptocurrency trading strategy on an exchange that only requires
                                regular monitoring of exchange rates.</b> However, when counting on the possible earnings,
                            you need to consider the commission that some exchanges charge. If the difference in the exchange rates of one currency on the exchanges is 2-3% or more, the sale can be profitable. If the exchange rate difference is less than 2%, the profit will be minimal or not at all.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let's say you bought 10 ETH at $210 ($2100) on one exchange, transferred them to your wallet and immediately sold on another exchange for $225 ($2250). Simple math again - your profit will be $150.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is worth noting that arbitrage on classic exchanges is a less profitable strategy that is available mainly to professionals. It takes a very fast robot to make money using arbitrage on traditional marketplaces. The response delay of the robot should be within 1 microsecond (one millionth of a second).
                        </p>
                        <p>On crypto exchanges, at least for now, robots that are a thousand times slower can still make money. With a relatively fast and smart algorithm, with this strategy you can earn up to 10% per month.
