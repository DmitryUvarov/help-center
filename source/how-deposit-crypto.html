                            <li>If you are depositing a coin for the first time, you must activate the deposit address first.</li>
                            <li>Bitcoin address will not accept deposits in ETH. Deposits of coins that do not match the address may not be recoverable. The same goes for most other coins.</li>

                            <li>
                                If the coin you want to deposit requires a Memo, Tag, Payment ID, or Message, ensure that it is entered correctly.
                                Otherwise, the coins won't arrive in your account.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Each ERC20 coin has a unique contract ID that can be checked from <a href="https://etherscan.io/" target="_self">Etherscan</a>.
                                Ensure that the contract ID of the coin you wish to deposit is the same as the one listed on Domain.
