                        <h2>Deposit Did Not Arrive or Deposited to the Wrong Address</h2>

                        <p><strong>Made a deposit to Domain but it hasn’t arrived? Don’t worry. As long as the address was filled correctly and you remembered to use the required Memo or Tag, your funds will be processed.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>There can be many reasons that crypto deposits can be delayed. This article explains the common reasons and provides corresponding solutions.</strong></p>
                        <h3><strong>1. There is no TXID</strong></h3>
                        <p>If you cannot find the transaction ID (TXID) of the deposit on the blockchain, this may indicate that the transfer was unsuccessful. It is recommended to contact the withdrawal platform to check the status of your withdrawal.</p>
                        <h3><strong>2. The number of confirmations is insufficient</strong></h3>
                        <p>Transactions on the blockchain must be confirmed by the nodes to be successful. The number of confirmations varies depending on the coin and network.</p>
                        <p>You can check the amount of confirmations required on the Domain deposit page. Please be patient and wait until the confirmation reaches the required amount.</p>
                        <h3><strong>3. There have been sufficient confirmations but funds haven’t arrived</strong></h3>
                        <p>Once there are enough confirmations on the blockchain, the Domain system will start proceeding your deposit. This can take up to 2-3 hours.</p>
                        <p>To check the number of confirmations for your deposit, refer to the blockchain explorers below:</p>

                        <p>The deposit address of some coins on Domain may be updated from time to time. Deposits using the old
                            Domain deposit address will be delayed by 12 hours. As such, it is recommended to always deposit to the
                            new Domain deposit address.</p>
