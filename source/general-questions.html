                        <h2>General Questions</h2>
                        <h3>What is cryptocurrency?</h3>
                        <p>Сryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptography for security, feature, that makes it difficult
                            to counterfeit. It is not issued by any central authority, rendering it theoretically immune to government
                            interference or manipulation.</p>

                        <h3>How do I register?</h3>
                        <p>Registering is as simple as 1, 2, 3. Go to main page and register with your email address to get started.
                            For registration, you will need a username and a password.</p>

                        <h3>How do I get verified?</h3>
                        <p>For certain kinds of Exchange Cryptocurrency Platform payments profile transactions, we might need
                            to verify your identity using information protecting your wallet. Verifying your identity helps prevent
                            fraud and ensures that no one, except you, is able to use your payment information to make changes.
                            You can make the first withdrawal of your funds to the wallet, which is registered and verified with
                            your account. Click to Deposit at the left tab, select the minimum amount BTC that will be added to
                            your account balance.</p>

                        <h3>What is ID verification for?</h3>
                        <p>ID verification is needed to increase the security and reliability of the account. In case of loss of access
                            to the mail to which the account is linked, you can always restore access with your Passport, driving
                            license and other legal ID. In addition, verification allows you to increase daily withdrawal limits.</p>

                        <h3>What is 2Factor Authentication (or 2FA)?</h3>
                        <p>We allow you to enable 2FA on your account by checking 2FA box in Personal Area – Settings. When
                            making a deposit or withdrawal, you will receive a link to the confirmation of the operation by email.
                            The confirmation link has a limited validity period. This greatly increases the security of your account
                            because if your device is hacked into, or your password is compromised, the hacker will still not be
                            able withdraw or transfer funds because they need access email, too. You may turn the verification
                            off anytime you want.</p>


                        <h3>I lost my 2Factor Device.</h3>
                        <p>Please contact Support and we will ask you questions to verify your account ownership.</p>


                        <h3>I have other questions.</h3>
                        <p>If you have other questions that are not answered here please feel free to contact support manager.</p>
